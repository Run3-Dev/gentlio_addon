# New Features Overview

## Group Join Detection
When a player **joins your party or raid**, Gentl.io now automatically checks for existing data:
- If a player has a **Gentl.io score**, you receive a **private chat message**.
- Message includes their **full name** and **rating**.
- Helps you stay informed **without needing to manually check** each player.

### Example:
``Gentl.io: Zorthan-Antonidas has a record (Score: 2.33)``

This feature works **silently in the background** and **only notifies you**, ensuring a smooth group experience.
