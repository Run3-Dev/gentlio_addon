# New Features Overview

## Character Interaction Log
When joining a group, all encountered characters are now saved automatically:
- Stores **name, realm, class, level**, and **timestamp** of the encounter.
- Updates existing entries if the same player joins again.
- Data is saved persistently in SavedVariables.

## Main UI: `/gentl` Command
Use `/gentl` to open the **Gentl.io character overview**:
- Left column shows all **grouped characters from the last 3 days**.
- Characters are sorted by **most recent encounter**.
- Clicking a character shows a **detail panel** on the right side.

## Ratings Display
If external or local ratings exist for a character:
- A summary is shown on the right:
  - **Score meaning** (e.g. "Very Good", "Negative Experience")
  - **Timestamp of each rating**
  - **List of all tags** used
- Ratings from both **external files** and **ingame-created ratings** are merged into one view.

## Add Rating Button
Below the rating list, a **“Add Rating”** button is now available:
- Opens a **form with multi-select checkboxes**.
- Tags are split into **positive** and **negative** groups.
- Each tag has an internal **weight from 0–5**.
- The average of the selected weights is stored as the rating score.
- Submitted ratings are stored in `GentlPendingRatings`, visible immediately in the UI.
- Tags are **cleared/reset** after submitting.

## Visual & UX Improvements
- UI now uses **dark background** with **white text**.
- Class and faction **icons** shown next to character names.
- Ratings are color-coded using **WoW item quality colors**.
- Tooltips show **race and class** on hover (for planned future use).
